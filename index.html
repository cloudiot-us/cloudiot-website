    Welcome to Cloudiot.US!

    <img src='images/cloudiot-transparent.png'>

    Here at Cloudiot, we're dedicated to taking the high quality of information security you expect of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and bringing it to the world of the cloud!  We're not exactly sure what a cloud is right now, but we're asking on StackOverflow and getting a bunch of downvotes for some reason.  In the meantime, we heard about this open source thing one time on Slashdot (is that still a thing?) and thought we'd ask all you guys to do free labor for us and help build a website!

    Well?  Get crackin'!
